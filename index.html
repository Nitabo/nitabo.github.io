                <p>I strongly believe that every design decision impact our users’ lives. The web is everywhere nowadays, conditioning our
				 access to democracy and education, to entertainment and information. It is our duty as "Web Makers" to consider the broader 
				 consequences of our work and engage in ethical design to ensure that the tools we create empower an impartial use of  
				 the power of Internet. I am currently writing a thesis to illustrate my views. Building a safe, fair and inclusive place is 
				 my motto and I wish to spread awareness among my peer developers and my clients. Here is my manifesto.</p>
